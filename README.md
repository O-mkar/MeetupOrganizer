# Meetup Organizer
ðŸ“² An iOS app for meetup goers, hosts, and organizers that extends native Meetup app's functionality and lets you upload multiple photos to meetup events. 

## Demo 

![App demo](https://github.com/ayunav/MeetupOrganizer/blob/master/MeetupOrganizerAppDemo.gif)

## How to run 

* Download the source file 
* Open `MeetupOrganizer.xcworkspace` project 
* You will see an error message and the missing `Constants.swift` file in the Project Navigator in the Constants folder.

MeetupOrganizer app uses OAuth protocol to let their users login and authenticate with their Meetup account. 
You will need to add `Constants.swift` file to the project with your API key and OAuth Consumer key and secret credentials.
  1. Create new file (cmd + N), name it `Constants`, and add to the project. 
  2. Copy-paste the code from [here](https://github.com/ayunav/MeetupOrganizer/blob/master/GitHubConstants.md), and insert your own API and OAuth keys. 

Build and run.  

You should be able to build and run the project now, but you may encounter a few other possible errors. 

*Missing module error:*

  1. Build (cmd + B) the project. The compiler should stop complaining. ðŸ™„ ðŸ˜‚  
  2. If building the project didn't help, run `pod install` in your terminal. Â 

It shouldn't be a problem, but just in case, if you're missing the image assets in the project, you can download and add them manually from [here](https://github.com/ayunav/MeetupOrganizer/tree/master/MeetupIcons).

### TO-DO

- on navigation to AddPhotosVC, display photos that are already on the server (fetch photos, display in the collection view)
- when uploading new photos, add new photos to the col view (different section? )
- improve response time on fetching upcoming and past events: cache response, add pull to refresh
- add log out/switch account button
- refactor auth code
- refactor image upload 
- handle errors, create user facing alerts 
- add empty states: no upcoming events, no past events
- nit: request access to photos on add photos button tapped, not on vc navigation
- add an app icon 

- upload activity indicator per cell
    - the col view will display selected photos
    - change cells' alpha to opaque
    - add spinning activity indicators indicating upload progress per photo/per cell
    - if there's a problem with upload, display a user facing error message
    - when upload is complete & successful (json response came back), stop & hide activity indicators, change cells' aipha to clear

Not sure about these: 

- ? add waitlist events
- ? deep link to photos at the event, or to the event, or to the meetup group. Play with it.
- ? add caption to uploaded photos: Uploaded by `member name` via Meetup Organizer iOS app by Ayuna Vogel (include link?)
- ? two sections for the images that are already on the server, and for the newly uploaded, with different section background images
