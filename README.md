**TO-DO:** 

- beautify collection view photo gallery  

- add and display placeholder image in the gallery collection view
- on navigation to AddPhotosVC, display photos that are already on the server (fetch photos, display in the collection view)
- when uploading new photos, add new photos to the col view 

- improve response time on fetching upcoming and past events: cache response, add pull to refresh
- add log out/switch account button

- refactor auth code, separate into a different manager class
- handle errors, create user facing alerts 
- add "Logging in..." progress indicator and "Successful login" UI/UX
- add empty states: No upcoming events, no past events 

- nit: request access to photos on add photos button tapped, not on vc navigation 
- nit: change back nav button to red meetup color arrow, no string

- upload activity indicator per cell
    - 1. the col view will display selected photos
    - 2. change cells' alpha to opaque
    - 3. add spinning activity indicators indicating upload progress per photo/per cell
    - 4. if there's a problem with upload, display a user facing error message
    - 5. when upload is complete & successful (json response came back), stop & hide activity indicators, change cells' aipha to clear

- ? add waitlist events
- ? deep link to photos at the event, or to the event, or to the meetup group. Play with it. 
- ? add caption to uploaded photos: Uploaded by <member name> via Meetup Organizer iOS app by Ayuna Vogel (include link?)

- single collection view cell selection to bring up a detail view
- 2 sections for the images that are already on the server, and for the newly uploaded, with different section background images
